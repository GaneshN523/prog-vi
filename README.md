🚀 Programming Visualizer
Overview
Programming Visualizer is an interactive learning platform designed for new learners to understand general programming concepts through graphical representations. It provides both high-level and low-level views of programming operations, helping users visualize how code execution works in real-time.

This project is built using React.js for an intuitive UI, making it easy to grasp complex programming logic through interactive visual tools.

🛠️ Features
✔️ Graphical Code Execution – Visualize step-by-step execution of programming operations.
✔️ High-Level & Low-Level Views – Understand how concepts work from an abstract level down to memory-level operations.
✔️ Interactive UI – Users can experiment with different programming constructs like loops, conditionals, functions, and memory allocation.
✔️ Real-Time Feedback – See immediate results of code execution through animations and diagrams.
✔️ Beginner-Friendly – No prior programming knowledge required; designed to be intuitive and educational.

📌 Tech Stack
Frontend
React.js (Vite.js) – For fast and optimized UI rendering
D3.js – For interactive visualizations
Tailwind CSS – For responsive UI design
Backend (optional, if needed)
FastAPI / Node.js (Express) – If implementing a backend for code execution

📜 How It Works
1️⃣ Users enter code into the interface.
2️⃣ The app parses the code and translates it into visual steps.
3️⃣ Animations display variables, loops, conditionals, and memory allocation in real time.
4️⃣ Users interact with the UI to change inputs and observe how execution changes.
